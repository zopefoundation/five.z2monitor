Introduction
============

This package enable to monitoring of Zope 2 instance from the command line. It plugs zc.monitor (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.monitor) and zc.z3monitor (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.z3monitor) in Zope 2.
zc.monitor use zc.ngi server and define another thread to handle monitoring. This way you should still be able to monitor your application even if the
HTTPServer is hanging.

Zope config
===========

Add this to your ``zope.conf`` to enable the zc.ngi server on the loopback interface on port 8888::

    <product-config five.z2monitor>
        bind 127.0.0.1:8888
    </product-config>
    
    
If you need IPv6, you can depend on ``zc.ngi>=2.1.0``.
In this case, you can bind to any IPv6 address with::

    <product-config five.z2monitor>
        bind :::8888
    </product-config>

Probes
======

This package has been tested with probes coming from different packages:

  - zc.z3monitor
  - Products.ZNagios
  - zc.monitorcache
  - zc.monitorlogstats
  - ztfy.monitor

To register your own probe, just define a new utility providing the ``zc.z3monitor.interfaces.IZ3MonitorPlugin`` interface. Like this::

  <utility
     component=".zc_uptime"
     provides="zc.z3monitor.interfaces.IZ3MonitorPlugin"
     name="uptime" />

and the component should look like this::

  def zc_uptime(connection, database='main'):
      """uptime of the zope instance in seconds"""
      app = App()
      elapsed = time.time() - app.Control_Panel.process_start
      print >> connection, elapsed
      app._p_jar.close()

ZODB connection is always the first parameter. You can add your own parameters after.

Once you start your instance you should see something like::

  INFO zc.ngi.async.server listening on ('127.0.0.1', 8888)

The ngi server is started and you can look up values with netcat for example::

  echo 'uptime' | nc -i 1 localhost 8888

plone.recipe.zope2instance
==========================

If you configure your zope instance using buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance).
To define the zc.z2monitor host and port use the ``zope-conf-additional`` option like this::

  [client1]
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  http-address = 8080
  user = admin:admin
  eggs =
    ${buildout:eggs}
  zcml =
    ${buildout:zcml}
  zope-conf-additional =
    <product-config five.z2monitor>
      bind 127.0.0.1:8888
    </product-config>


Once the instance is running, you will be able to ask the available probes from the
command line using::

  bin/instance monitor dbinfo main

which is the equivalent to::

  echo 'dbinfo main' | nc -i 1 <zc.monitor host> <zc.monitor port>

To know the registered probes, Use this command::

  bin/instance monitor help
